# xflp
xflp is a solver for truck loading problems in 3D with real world constraints

It supports:
* single or multiple bin packing
* rotating of items for 1 axis
* simulation of loading and unloading of items  
* Constraints:
  * Max height of loading space
  * Max weight of loading space
  * Max bearing weight of each item
  * last in, first out condition
* consideration of stacking groups
* consideration of container types
* consideration of immersive depth during stacking
* consideration of permissible axle load (2 axles)

Optimization:
* Construction heuristic
* GRASP heuristic
  * Swap and relocate neighborhood search

# Usage
```
XFLP xflp = new XFLP();
xflp.addContainer().setLength(13500).setWidth(2500).setHeight(3000).setMaxWeight(25000);
xflp.addItem().setExternID("Packet 1").setLength(13500).setWidth(2500).setHeight(3000).setWeight(25000);
xflp.addItem().setExternID("Packet 2").setLength(13500).setWidth(2500).setHeight(3000).setWeight(25000);
xflp.addItem().setExternID("Packet 3").setLength(13500).setWidth(2500).setHeight(3000).setWeight(25000);

xflp.executeLoadPlanning();

LPReport report = xflp.getReport();
int nbrOfUnloadedPackages = report.getSummary().getNbrOfUnLoadedPackages();
```

## Change log
### 0.6.1 - Fixed Location feature
- User can set loading and unloading location for each item. This is useful during Vehicle Routing, when sequences of loading and unloading need to be checked.
  Here was a bug in code, where locations were not sorted in correct order. This is fixed now, but there are prerequisits:
  - The name of a location (load or unload) must correspond with the ordering in sequence.
  - The LIFO loading constraint must be activated as it is not default.
  - Example for infeasible solution
  ```
  XFLP xflp = new XFLP()
  xflp.getParameter().setLifoImportance(1)

  xflp.addItem().setExternID("P1").setLoadingLocation("Loc 1").setUnloadingLocation("Loc 3")
  xflp.addItem().setExternID("P2").setLoadingLocation("Loc 2").setUnloadingLocation("Loc 4")

  xflp.executeLoadPlanning()
  assert xflp.getReport().getUnplannedPackages().size() > 0
  ```

### 0.6.0 - Update to Java 17, permissible axle load and more
- Changed xflp to Java 17. Due to use of records, xflp is not compatible with Java < 17 anymore.
- Add space-based checking when items are added and removed in a container. This improves the planning performance and 
reduces the code complexity.
- Add constraint: permissible axle load for 2 axles  

### 0.5.2 - Performance upgrade
- Improved bearing check by storing bearing capacities during container-adding.
  - For big problems the runtime improves by 43%.
- Refactored and removed old code

### 0.5.1 - Performance upgrade
- Add spaces for faster checking of possible insert positions
  - Each position defines a list of spaces, where items might fit into.
  - Adding new item means complex calculation/correction of spaces
  - Check, whether item fits at a certain position is reduced from O(n) to O(1)
    - For big problems the runtime improves by factor 3.
- Refactorings of optimization types 
- Minor refactoring of ground contact checking
- Internal refactorings

### 0.5.0 - Performance upgrade
- Refactoring of container code
  - Split algorithmic functions to service classes
  - Add general definition of containers
  - Have at least 2 implementations of container:
    - Items can be added and removed (current implementation)
    - Items can only be added. Implementation can be way simpler and performance is better.
- Refactoring of current container service methods, which improves performance
- Added check for duplicate positions, which maybe bring a bit of performance
- Import function checks, which type of container is necessary.
- After import, some values of items are checked for validity.


### 0.4.1
- Add immersive depth

### 0.4.0 - More restrictions
- Add restriction, that one item must be fully placed on top of one item
  - Business motivation: Certain packages may have restriction due to shoulder or feet forms, that stacking on multiple items is not possible.
- Fixed copyright information
- Refactored import classes
- Use specific exception instead of runtime exceptions

### 0.3.2
- Added SpotBugs in build process to find smellies
- Fixed some smellies
  - In many cases a XFLPException is thrown instead of IllegalArgumentExceptions
### 0.3.1
- "Fast Fixed solver" uses new width proportion factor for choosing the next insert position
### 0.3.0 - Stacking groups
- Fix of stacking group feature
- Added a priorization criteria for choosing the next insert position. It takes the proportion of the item to the container into account.
- More reasonable structure of planning heuristics
### 0.2.0
- First stable release
